ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Valentin, I have a double degree in Machine Learning from the University of Cergy-Pontoise and an engineering degree from E.N.S.E.A. ðŸŽ“

I wish to lead end-to-end projects (Data Extraction and Processing, Design and Modeling of Machine Learning solutions).

I first specialized in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, as a Data Scientist in the SkyCentre research and development laboratory at Thales. 
Then, I decided to work in the insurance and finance fields, as a Data Scientist at Le Conservateur group since 2020.

Iâ€™m interested in end-to-end projects with Data Extraction / Processing, Design and Modeling of Machine Learning solutions. I am particularly attached to the relationship with my team, the business experts or the customers .

As I want to be more autonomous in my Data Scientist position, Iâ€™m currently learning :
- Data Analyst (Power BI / Tableau) ðŸ“Š
- Data Engineer tools (Airlow) ðŸ”©
